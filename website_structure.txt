3. RESULTS & KPIs PAGE (/results)
3.1. Hero section
Page title (H1):
Results & KPIs
Subtitle:
We build AI systems for business‑critical operations — and we measure what
they actually change: cycle times, error rates, manual effort, risk and cost.
Intro:
Every engagement with us starts with a simple question:​
“How will we know this AI solution is successful?”​
Together with your team, we define 3–5 concrete KPIs before we design the
system. Then we implement, measure and iterate until the numbers move — or
we stop the project instead of hiding behind buzzwords.

3.2. “How we define success”
Section title:
How we define success
Text:
We don’t treat “AI” as a goal in itself. For each project, we agree on measurable
outcomes in three dimensions:
●​ Operational impact – faster decisions and processes​
●​ Quality & risk – fewer errors, better use of existing knowledge, more
consistent decisions​
●​ Cost & productivity – less manual effort, more work done with the
same team​

For business‑critical processes we always add risk and compliance metrics,
so your risk and audit teams can stand behind the solution.

3.3. “Impact at a glance”
Section title:
Impact at a glance
Text:
Across recent projects, our AI solutions have delivered:
●​ 20–40% faster end‑to‑end execution for selected operational processes​
●​ 30–50% less manual effort for recurring analysis and reporting​
●​ 30–50% shorter time‑to‑delivery for selected development tasks​
●​ 50–70% less time spent searching and reading internal documents for
recurring questions​
●​ Fewer escalations and errors, thanks to more consistent use of
existing knowledge and playbooks​

These numbers are not “theoretical potential” — they are measured before/after
deltas on real processes. Exact values differ by client and domain.

3.4. Case studies
Section title:
Selected case studies
(4 кейса — анонимные, можно заменить реальными названиями.)

Case study 1 — Global e‑commerce (customer operations)
Headline:
Reducing handling time for complex support cases
Challenge:
A global e‑commerce company was facing increasing complexity in customer
support: more products, more regions, more exceptions. Handling time for
complex cases was growing, and senior agents were spending a lot of time on
manual investigation and drafting responses.

What we did:
●​ Designed an AI‑assisted workflow for complex tickets​
●​ Added automatic case summaries and context gathering from internal
systems​
●​ Implemented next‑best‑action suggestions based on policies and
historical resolutions​
●​ Connected internal playbooks and policies as a trusted knowledge
source with citations​

Results:
●​ −35% average time‑to‑resolution for complex cases in the pilot region​
●​ 60% of cases processed with AI assistance in the first 3 months​
●​ <2% re‑opened tickets due to AI‑related errors​
●​ Higher satisfaction scores from both agents and customers​

Case study 2 — Financial services (KYC reviews)
Headline:
Speeding up KYC reviews while keeping risk under control
Challenge:
A financial services provider needed to speed up periodic KYC reviews. Manual
data collection and drafting risk assessments were consuming a lot of analyst
time. At the same time, risk and compliance teams could not accept lower
control.
What we did:
●​ Mapped the end‑to‑end KYC review process with risk and compliance
teams​
●​ Built an AI‑orchestrated workflow that:​
○​ collects relevant data from internal systems and external sources,​

○​ drafts risk summaries and recommendations,​
○​ flags edge cases and inconsistencies for human review​
●​ Ensured that every recommendation came with traceable references to
underlying data and policies​

Results:
●​ −30–40% reduction in review cycle time​
●​ More consistent risk assessments across analysts and regions​
●​ Better transparency for internal audit: clearer records of what was
reviewed and why decisions were made​

Case study 3 — Online business (document & knowledge intelligence)
Headline:
Turning scattered documents into a trusted knowledge layer
Challenge:
A digital services company had thousands of contracts, policies and technical
documents spread across different tools and repositories. Teams were spending
hours searching, re‑reading and copying fragments into new documents — or
they were simply guessing.
What we did:
●​ Implemented a document ingestion pipeline for contracts, policies,
procedures and technical documentation​
●​ Built a knowledge layer on top, allowing users to ask questions and
receive answers with citations​
●​ Added tools to compare versions, highlight key changes and detect
potential risks in updates​

Results:

●​ 50–70% less time spent searching and reading documents for recurring
questions​
●​ Higher consistency of answers across teams and regions​
●​ Fewer missed clauses and outdated references in key decisions,
according to internal audits​

Case study 4 — Technology company (AI‑augmented software delivery)
Headline:
Accelerating delivery of core platform features
Challenge:
A technology company needed to deliver new features in a core platform faster,
without increasing defect rates or technical debt. Traditional development cycles
were too slow, and previous “AI code helper” experiments did not fit their
architecture and quality standards.
What we did:
●​ Introduced an AI‑augmented delivery process for selected services​
●​ Used AI to assist with architecture options, implementation, tests
and refactoring​
●​ Integrated AI suggestions into existing code review and CI/CD
processes, instead of bypassing them​

Results:
●​ 30–50% faster delivery for selected features​
●​ Lower defect rates in early production releases for those services​
●​ More time for senior engineers to focus on architecture and complex
design, instead of boilerplate​

3.5. “What we measure and how”

Section title:
What we measure and how
Text:
Our KPI framework is designed to be understandable for C‑level, operations, IT
and risk teams alike. We group metrics into five categories.
Metric categories (bullets):
1.​ Speed & throughput​
○​ Time‑to‑decision​
○​ End‑to‑end process cycle time​
○​ Time‑to‑resolution (for incidents, tickets, cases)​
2.​ Quality & consistency​
○​ Error and rework rates​
○​ Consistency of decisions across teams/regions​
○​ Coverage and correctness of references to internal knowledge​
3.​ Productivity & cost​
○​ Manual effort per case / ticket / report​
○​ Volume of work handled per FTE​
○​ Cost per processed unit (case, transaction, review, feature)​
4.​ Risk & compliance​
○​ Number and severity of risk/compliance incidents related to the process​
○​ Audit findings related to AI‑supported operations​
○​ Coverage of critical controls and checks​
5.​ Adoption & satisfaction​
○​ Active usage of AI assistant / workflow​

○​ User satisfaction (agents, analysts, engineers)​
○​ Stakeholder confidence (operations, risk, C‑level)​

Closing paragraph:
For each project we pick the relevant metrics, define baselines together with
your team, and track progress over time. If the numbers don’t move in the right
direction, we adjust the solution — or stop it, instead of scaling something that
doesn’t work.

3.6. “Working with your data and systems” (optional)
Section title:
Working with your data, systems and risk constraints
Text:
We don’t operate AI in isolation. For every engagement we:
●​ Integrate with your existing systems and data sources instead of
building separate “shadow tools”​
●​ Align with your risk, security and compliance teams from day one​
●​ Make sure every AI‑supported decision is traceable back to data and
documents​
●​ Provide you with a clear view of how the system behaves and how it is
monitored​

This is what allows us — and you — to stand behind the KPIs and the decisions
your AI systems help to make.

4. TEAM & STORY PAGE (/team или
/about)

4.1. Hero section
Page title (H1):
Our team & story
Subtitle:
We are a senior AI engineering team with more than 20 years in AI‑powered
products.​
Among us are software architects, data scientists and professional
neuroscientists — all focused on bringing AI safely into your business‑critical
workflows.
Short intro:
We started in the early 2000s working with enterprise AI platforms such as
Autonomy as certified specialists. Since then, we’ve built and operated AI‑driven
systems across finance, e‑commerce, logistics, telecom and SaaS.​
Today we use that experience — and our background in neuroscience and
complex systems — to design AI solutions that work in real organizations, not
just in demos.

4.2. “Our story”
Section title:
Our story
Text:
Our roots go back more than two decades, when “AI” mostly meant enterprise
search, text analytics and recommendation engines.
We started as certified specialists on platforms like Autonomy, helping large
organizations turn unstructured text into search, alerts and decision support.
Those early systems powered knowledge‑intensive work long before modern AI
models became widely available.
Over the years we’ve worked with online businesses and enterprises across
Europe and the US, building and maintaining systems for:
●​ search, relevance and recommendations,​
●​ analytics and risk scoring,​

●​ workflow automation and decision support,​
●​ large‑scale content and document management.​

When large language models became practical for production use, we didn’t
start from zero. We already knew what it takes to run AI in production:
integrating with existing systems, respecting regulations, handling noisy data
and making results explainable enough for real teams.

4.3. “Who we are today”
Section title:
Who we are today
Text:
Today EtaCar Systems is a focused team of senior AI engineers, architects and
product leaders.​
We combine:
●​ long‑term experience in AI‑powered products,​
●​ deep understanding of how organizations actually work,​
●​ and practical knowledge of modern AI tooling and infrastructure.​

Our work centers on business‑critical workflows — the ones that affect revenue,
risk, operations and compliance. We help leadership teams decide where AI can
safely amplify their people and where it should not be used at all.

4.4. “Neuroscience and AI — why it matters”
Section title:
Neuroscience and AI — why it matters
Text:
Several members of our team are professional neuroscientists with academic
and industry backgrounds.​

They bring expertise in how complex systems learn, adapt and sometimes fail
— from neural circuits to human behavior.
This matters for our clients because:
●​ We design AI systems with a strong intuition for how people actually
think and make decisions under pressure.​
●​ We are careful about cognitive load, trust and explainability for the
people who will work with AI every day.​
●​ We pay attention not only to model performance, but also to how AI
interacts with teams, incentives and culture.​

In practice, this means our solutions are not just technically advanced — they
are easier for people to adopt and safer to embed into critical processes.

4.5. “How we think about AI in organizations”
Section title:
How we think about AI in organizations
Text:
We do not treat AI as a magic layer you can sprinkle on top of everything.​
We see it as an additional capability inside your organization that must:
●​ fit your existing architecture and data,​
●​ respect your risk and compliance boundaries,​
●​ and support your people instead of replacing their judgement.​

That is why we:
●​ start from your workflows and decisions, not from a specific model,​
●​ design clear roles for AI, humans and existing systems,​
●​ and insist on measurable KPIs and governance from the beginning.​
